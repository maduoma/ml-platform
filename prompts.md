# Project: Building a Robust MLOps Platform for Personalized Music Therapy
This project is designed to address the core needs outlined in the job description, focusing on building a production-ready ML platform from the ground up to support LUCID's unique application of AI in consumer health and wellness.

# Project Summary
The goal of this project is to build a scalable and reliable Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platform that will serve as the backbone for developing, deploying, and maintaining LUCID's AI-driven music therapy models. This platform will empower the Machine Learning team to rapidly iterate on models that personalize music to improve mental well-being, while ensuring the highest standards of robustness, scalability, and regulatory compliance.

# Alignment with LUCID's Mission
This project directly contributes to LUCID's mission of pioneering mobile health experiences by:

- Accelerating Innovation: By automating and streamlining the ML lifecycle, the platform will enable the ML team to focus on advancing the core "Emotion AI" and "BioMIR" technologies.

- Ensuring Therapeutic Efficacy: A robust platform with rigorous testing and monitoring will ensure the deployed models are effective and provide real therapeutic value to users.

- Building for Scale: As LUCID's user base grows, the platform will be able to handle the increased demand for personalized music recommendations and therapies.

# End-to-End Project Plan
This project is broken down into phases, with clear deliverables at each stage.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Core Infrastructure (First 60 Days)

### Objective: Stand up the foundational components of the ML platform.

- Key Activities:

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

        Develop Terraform scripts to provision a dedicated Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE).

        Define networking, security groups, and IAM roles.

Kubeflow Installation and Configuration:

Deploy Kubeflow using Helm charts.

Configure Kubeflow components, including Pipelines, Notebooks, and the central dashboard.

MLFlow Integration:

Set up an MLFlow tracking server for experiment logging and artifact storage.

Integrate MLFlow with Kubeflow Pipelines to automatically log experiment runs.

Initial CI/CD Pipeline:

Create a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images for ML code.

### Phase 2: Model Deployment and Serving

Objective: Enable seamless deployment and serving of machine learning models.

Key Activities:

KServe Implementation:

Install and configure KServe on the Kubernetes cluster for scalable model serving.

Develop a standardized process for packaging and deploying models to KServe.

Deployment Strategies:

Implement canary and blue-green deployment strategies to ensure safe rollouts of new model versions.

Model Registry:

Establish a formal model registry using MLFlow to version and manage production-ready models.

### Phase 3: Monitoring, Observability, and Model Maintenance

Objective: Implement robust monitoring and automated processes for maintaining model performance.

Key Activities:

Drift Detection:

Integrate a data and model drift detection tool like Evidently AI.

Set up automated checks to monitor for changes in input data distributions and model prediction behavior.

Automated Retraining:

Create Kubeflow Pipelines that can be triggered by drift detection alerts to automatically retrain models on new data.

Observability Dashboard:

Build Grafana dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) of the ML platform and deployed models, using Prometheus for metrics collection.

### Phase 4: Data Platform Integration and Advanced Features

Objective: Enhance the platform with advanced data management and scalability features.

Key Activities:

Feature Store:

Collaborate with the Data Platform Engineer to design and implement a feature store for sharing and reusing features across different models.

Scalability Enhancements:

Configure GPU autoscaling for training deep learning models.

Explore and implement Ray for distributed data processing and training.

Security and Compliance:

Implement best practices for securing the platform and ensuring data privacy, with considerations for healthcare data regulations like HIPAA.

### Phase 5: Documentation, Training, and Handover

Objective: Prepare documentation, training, and handover materials for the project.

Key Activities:

Documentation: Write detailed documentation for the project, including architecture diagrams, user guides, and code examples.

Training: Provide training materials for the ML team, including hands-on tutorials and training sessions.

Handover: 
Hand over the project to the ML team for further development and maintenance.
